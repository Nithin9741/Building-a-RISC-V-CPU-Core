Inverter

*Unlike Verilog, there was no need to declare your signals (wires) ($out and $in1). 
*In TL-Verilog, your assignment statement acts as the declaration of its output signal(s).
*This circuit has a dangling input signal and a dangling output signal. It also probably has a dangling $reset signal that was provided in the template.
*These result in non-fatal warning/error conditions. They are reported, but they do not prevent simulation


**In place of "//...", type "$out = ! $in1;". Be sure to preserve the 3-spaces of indentation, similar to the surrounding expressions. This is an inverter
